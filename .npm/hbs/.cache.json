Note how the index.hbs file defines extra stylesheets and scripts to be injected into the layout. They are put into the head section and at the end of the body respectively. If this was not done, the stylesheet would be in the body and the script would print `foo bar` too soon.\n\n","readmeFilename":"Readme.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/donpark/hbs/issues"},"_id":"hbs@2.3.1","dist":{"shasum":"0e957f025c5f0738f7471178775460934cf1205b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hbs/-/hbs-2.3.1.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.3.5","_npmUser":{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"donpark","email":"donpark@docuverse.com"},{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"}]},"2.4.0":{"name":"hbs","description":"Express.js template engine plugin for Handlebars","version":"2.4.0","homepage":"https://github.com/donpark/hbs","author":{"name":"Don Park","email":"donpark@docuverse.com","url":"http://blog.docuverse.com"},"main":"lib/hbs.js","directories":{"lib":"./lib"},"dependencies":{"handlebars":"1.0.12","walk":"2.2.1"},"devDependencies":{"mocha":"1.6.0","npm":"1.3.6","request":"2.25.0"},"scripts":{"test":"mocha"},"engines":{"node":">= 0.4.0"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/donpark/hbs.git"},"readme":"# hbs [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/donpark/hbs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/donpark/hbs) #\n\n[Express.js](http://github.com/visionmedia/express) view engine for\n[handlebars.js](http://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js)\n\n## Install ##\n\n```\nnpm install hbs\n```\n\n## Use ##\n\nUsing *hbs* as the default view engine requires just one line of code in your app setup. This will render `.hbs` files when `res.render` is called.\n\n```javascript\napp.set('view engine', 'hbs');\n```\n\nTo use a different extension (i.e. html) for your template files:\n\n```javascript\napp.set('view engine', 'html');\napp.engine('html', require('hbs').__express);\n```\n\n## Helpers and Partials ##\n\nhbs exposes the `registerHelper` and `registerPartial` method from handlebars.\n\n```javascript\nvar hbs = require('hbs');\n\nhbs.registerHelper('helper_name', function(...) { ... });\nhbs.registerPartial('partial_name', 'partial value');\n```\n\nFor convenience, `registerPartials` provides a quick way to load all partials from a specific directory:\n\n```javascript\nvar hbs = require('hbs');\n\nhbs.registerPartials(__dirname + '/views/partials');\n```\n\nPartials that are loaded from a directory are named based on their filename, where spaces and hyphens are replaced with an underscore character:\n\n```\ntemplate.html      -> {{> template}}\ntemplate 2.html    -> {{> template_2}}\nlogin view.hbs     -> {{> login_view}}\ntemplate-file.html -> {{> template_file}}\n```\n\nSee the [handlebars.js](http://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) README and docs for more information.\n\n## handlebars ##\n\nThe handlebars require used by hbs can be accessed via the `handlebars` property on the `hbs` module.\n\nIf you wish to use handlebars methods like `SafeString` please do so on this property. Do not register helpers or partials in this way.\n\n```\n// hbs.handlebars is the handlebars module\nhbs.handlebars === require('handlebars');\n```\n\n## Recipes ##\n\n### more than one instance ###\nYou can create isolated instances of hbs using the `create()` function on the module object.\n\n```\nvar hbs = require('hbs');\n\nvar instance1 = hbs.create();\nvar instance2 = hbs.create();\n\napp.engine('html', instance1.__express);\napp.engine('hbs', instance2.__express);\n```\n\nEach instance has the same methods/properties as the `hbs` module object. The module object is actually just an instance created for you automatically.\n\n### extra scripts or styles ##\nSometimes it is useful to have custom scripts or stylesheets on your pages. Handlebars does not provide a way to import or extend a template, but through the use of helpers you can create a similar result.\n\nWe can take advantage of the fact that our body template is processed before the layout template. Knowing this, we can create two helpers `block` and `extend` which can be used to 'inject' custom stylesheets or scripts into the layout template. The `block` helper will act as a placeholder for values specified in earlier `extend` helpers.\n\nSee examples/extend for a working example. Note how the index.hbs file defines extra stylesheets and scripts to be injected into the layout. They are put into the head section and at the end of the body respectively. If this was not done, the stylesheet would be in the body and the script would print `foo bar` too soon.\n\n","readmeFilename":"Readme.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/donpark/hbs/issues"},"_id":"hbs@2.4.0","dist":{"shasum":"f4c956cb660d6974dc61214b7c49a21f6aaa3f51","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hbs/-/hbs-2.4.0.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.3.8","_npmUser":{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"donpark","email":"donpark@docuverse.com"},{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"}]}},"maintainers":[{"name":"donpark","email":"donpark@docuverse.com"},{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"}],"author":{"name":"Don
